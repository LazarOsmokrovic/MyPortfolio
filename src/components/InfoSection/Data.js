    description1: 'Hi, I am Lazar Osmokrovic. I\'m 24 years old and I live in Serbia. Currently l\'m on final year at The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Applied Studies and l\'m working on my thesis. I was working as a junior mobile developer at IGT. Although I\'m not working there anymore, I continued learning more about mobile develompent. Mostly in flutter framework. Recently I started to learn react as well, as it\'s quite simillar to flutter logic and strucure, I found it equally interestending and easy to understand. I\'m hoping I could get a position as a junior frontend developer in a company where I could grow as a developer and further improve my programing skills.',
